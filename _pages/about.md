I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst working with [Przemyslaw A. Grabowicz](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/grabowicz-przemek) and [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/).

My research focuses on explainability techniques, discrimination measures, and fair learning methods for machine learning. Specifically, I intersect these topics to introduce methods that (i) prevent discrimination in supervised learning in an explainable way and (ii) provide fair and robust explanations and algorithmic recourse. My current research focuses on utilizing and developing white-box and black-box techniques to explain large language model decisions w.r.t. fairness. 

In Fall 2020, I joined the Ph.D program at UMass Amherst and received the [GEM Ph.D. Fellowship](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/). In 2023, I won the [UMass Amherst Commitment to Diversity Award](https://www.cics.umass.edu/news/nicholas-perello-18-be-honored-umass-amherst-commencement-commitment-diversity-award).
