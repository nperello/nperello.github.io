I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst working with [Przemyslaw A. Grabowicz](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/grabowicz-przemek) and [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/).

My research focuses on fairness in machine learning and its intersection with explainability and transparency. E.g., how to use tools that explain black-box models to reveal potential biases in decision-making systems and how can we prevent such biases (see blog post [here](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/equate-ml/2022/04/07/how-to-train-models-that-do-not-propagate-discrimination/) about this). My current interests lie in this and how can we ensure that explainability methods are unbiased. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and in Math at UMass in 2018. After starting my M.S. that same year, I eventually transferred to the M.S./Ph.D program at UMass Amherst in 2020. In 2020 I received the [GEM Fellowship](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/). In 2023 I won the [UMass Amherst Commitment to Diversity Award](https://www.cics.umass.edu/news/nicholas-perello-18-be-honored-umass-amherst-commencement-commitment-diversity-award).
